      The Day of the Dead (Spanish: Día de Muertos) is a Mexican holiday
      celebrated in Mexico and elsewhere associated with the Catholic
      celebrations of All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day. The multi-day holiday
      involves family and friends gathering to pray for and to remember friends
      and family members who have died. It is commonly portrayed as a day of
      celebration rather than mourning.[1] Mexican academics are divided on
      whether the festivity has indigenous pre-hispanic roots or whether it is a
      20th-century rebranded version of a Spanish tradition developed by the
      presidency of Lazaro Cardenas to encourage Mexican nationalism through an
      "Aztec" identity.[2][3] The festivity has become a national symbol and as
      such is taught in the nation's school system, typically asserting a native
      origin.[4] In 2008, the tradition was inscribed in the Representative List
      of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.[5] In other
      Spanish-speaking countries, the day is more commonly called Día de los
      Muertos or by its official name on the Catholic calendar: Día de los
      Fieles Difuntos. Whereas in Spain and most of Latin America the public
      holiday and similar traditions are typically held on All Saints' Day
      (Todos los Santos), the Mexican government under Cardenas switched the
      festivity to All Souls' Day (Fieles Difuntos) in an effort to secularize
      the festivity and distinguish it from the Hispanic Catholic festival.[6]

      Ofrendas are an essential part of the Day of the Dead celebrations. The
      word ofrenda means offering in Spanish. They are also called altares or
      altars, but they are not for worship. Some people mistakenly think that
      Mexicans that set up ofrendas for their defunct relatives are actually
      worshiping them. Nothing further from the truth. The vast majority of
      Mexicans are Christian Catholics, so they only worship God.

      set up to remember and honor the memory of their ancestors. Before setting
      an altar, they thoroughly clean their house. We must remember they are
      going to have very important “visitors”. The ofrenda is set on a table,
      covered with a fine tablecloth, preferably white. Then the papel picado,
      cut tissue paper, is set over the cloth.
